Welcome to my first blog post. This is a test file, still figuring out how
I want to do blog posts from now on. My initial guess is to sort blog posts
into specific topics via parsing thru each blog post's tags.
Maybe that's inefficient, perhaps I should just sort them into deeper folders.
That actually makes more sense

I want to name this site my Soapbox cuz its just me getting on my soapbox and preaching to people
That said, Comments would be good for additional discourse. However that means increasing the stack, getting good at docker, etc. Probably can't just put it on github pages then. Maybe have a thing that says "Don't feel awkward, send me an email about anything that I'm talking about here!" as a stand in for comments - just to get any audience going.
