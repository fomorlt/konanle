Welcome to my first blog post. This is a test file, still figuring out how
I want to do blog posts from now on. My initial guess is to sort blog posts
into specific topics via parsing thru each blog post's tags.
Maybe that's inefficient, perhaps I should just sort them into deeper folders.
That actually makes more sense

I want to name this site Konan's Soapbox cuz its just me getting on my soapbox and preaching to people
That said, Comments would be good for additional discourse. However that means increasing the stack, getting good at docker, etc. Probably can't just put it on github pages then. Maybe have a thing that says "Don't feel awkward, send me an email about anything that I'm talking about here!" as a stand in for comments - just to get any audience going.

categories i want to do:
Book Club - where i just talk about everything books
Arcade Corner - where I maybe do a lil update on the games I play
Bits and Bobs - where I do lil blog posts on random objects and items like ereaders, laptops, mice, etc.
Worldbuilding - where I post random worldbuilding ideas to share with everyone
